Enhanced EMP modeling (all of these enhancements made by) Merlyn(Drforbin)Cousins.

The enhancements are the general cleanup of code and the ability to write plot data 
to a gnuplot file for later viewing.

The procedure for compile and first run are as follows;

gfortran -o empplot EMPNPLT_FG2_plot.f
gfortran -o empplot -ffpe-trap=invalid,zero,overflow -g EMPNPLT_FG2_plot.f

./empplot <IN3x.txt

gnuplot -p gnuplot_draw

PLEASE NOTE: I was asked to do this evaluation. I only proceeded from an academic perspective.
PLEASE read the entire lecture before drawing any conclusions. I DONOT REPEAT donot feel EMP is ANY 
major threat to the USA infrastructure, and I donot suppose the throughly right wing reactionary push to 
make it so. THE facts simple do not support this conculsion. Most of this entire project is based on
inaccurate or junk science to push an agenda, again please read entire lecture.

Thank you.

Merlyn.
